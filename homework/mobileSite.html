        <h1>Site Contrast</h1>
            <p>Worst site: Best Buy</p>
                <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/?ref=30&loc=KW-4327&ksid=26dc8b2e-0dfa-8128-3b4e-000048681ea9&ksprof_id=3&ksaffcode=72330&ksdevice=c&gclid=CIDLwI-q1NECFRB4fgodcgIIXg">Best Buy</a>
            <p>Bose was different than best buy because they were better at targeting their audience. Bose had pictures of people using their headphones while they were running and playing sports or listening to music with their friends. and they made their products bold and colorful and it was fun to look at while Best Buy had their pictures smaller and hard to see.</p>
            <p>Bose was better at meeting the needs of the audience because they had discriptions on each product which helped you find what you were looking for and you were able to find which item fit your needs. Best Buy just had basic information on what they were selling. </p>
            <p>Bose was more organized and they kept everything simple and to the point while Best Buy was more cluttered and had random things that were a distraction.</p>
            <p>With Best Buy you had to do a lot more searching. Products also didn't have a clear disription and you had to look for more information. Pictures were also harder to see so you had to zoom in and out. The pictures in bose were the main point of the website and with a dark background the product was able to stand out more. Searching for something was fast and simple and they made things easy to read. </p>
