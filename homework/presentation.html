        <h1>The different between Relative & Aboslute Positioning</h1>
        <p> This is the story of Henry the duck, but it’s a different Henry to the Henry you might know. Because, not everybody knows this, but just about every duck is called Henry! And this Henry didn’t like rain. It wasn’t that he didn’t like water, he loved water. If fact, every afternoon Henry took a long swim in the lake, but rain was another matter entirely. And unfortunately the area where Henry lived got lots and lots of rain.</p>
