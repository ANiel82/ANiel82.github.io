        <h1>The difference between Relative & Aboslute Positioning</h1>
        <p> This is the story of Henry the duck, but it’s a different Henry to the Henry you might know. Because, not everybody knows this, but just about every duck is called Henry! And this Henry didn’t like rain. It wasn’t that he didn’t like water, he loved water. If fact, every afternoon Henry took a long swim in the lake, but rain was another matter entirely. And unfortunately the area where Henry lived got lots and lots of rain.</p>

    <h2>Absolute Positioning</h2>
    <h3>Positions</h3>
    <p>There are four different position values:</p>
    <p>static, relative, fixed, Absolute</p>
    <p>Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties.</p>
    <h3>Position: absolute</h3>
    <p>Absolutely positioned elements are moved in relation to their closest relatively positioned parent element.</p>
    <p>Should a relatively positioned parent element not exist, the absolutely positioned element will be positioned in relation to the body element.</p>
    <h3>Position: relative</h3>
    <p>If you want an absolute positioned element to honor the positioning of its parent element the parent element must have position: relative</p>
    <p>Because an element is absolutely positioned, it does not sit within the normal flow of the page and will overlap any surrounding elements</p>
    <p>Typically, most positioning can be handled without the use of the position properties but in certain cases they can be extremely helpful.</p>
